# mathPAD
Web based full page calculator similar to MathCad

The original idea was to create a single page web based version of something similar to MathCad.  This was to support using the application in an environment where running a web server was not possible.  The initial commit is the bare file that was created.

This application was originally run on a web server where the units were held in a database.

The goal is to get this developed into a legitimate application again.  It needs some cleanup on all the different files that have been included.  That will be the starting point.
